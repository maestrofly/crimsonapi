LOW LEVEL OVERVIEW
- understand the basics : JS Fundamentals, Variables, Data Types, Functions, Basic Control Flow
- Learn about API : Understand what an API is and how it works
- Choose a server sided Technology : NodeJS which allows you to run JS on the server. NodeJS has a framework called Express.js that simplifies API Development.
- Set up a development Environment: Install NodeJS and a code editor (VS Code) on your PC. That is a workspace for writing and running code.
- Plan the API : Determine the functionality you want to provide in your E-commerce API. Eg You might need endpoints for creating products, retrieving product details or processing orders.
- Start coding : Begin by setting up a basic server using Express.js
create routes for each end point you planned earlier and define the logic for handling requests and sending reponses
- Test your API: Using tools like Postman or Curl to send requests to your API and verify that its working as expected. This will help you identify and fix any issues.
- Learn and Improve: Continuously expand your knowledge by exploring more advanced topics like authentication, security and database integration.


HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW
1. Define the endpoints : Determine the different routes and functionalities your API will have such as creating a new product, retrieving products details or processing orders.

2. Set up a server : Use a framework like Express.js to create a server that will handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate endpoints.

3. Implement the endpoints : write the logic for each endpoint, handling the necessary database operations ( eg. CRUD Operations) and returning the appropriate responses.

4. Handle authentication and security : Implement authentication mechanisms like JSONWeb Tokens (JWT) to secure your API and ensure that onlu authorised users can access certain endpoints.

5. TEST AND DEBUG : Use tools like Postman or curl to test your API endpoints and ensure they're functioning as expected. Debug any issues that arise during testing.

6. Document your API : Create clear and comprehensive documentation that explains how to use your API including available endpoints, request/response formats and any required authentication.

Remember building an API can be complex so its important to have a solid understanding of JAVASCRIPT, server-side development and RESTFUL API principles.
